# Capstone Project

All of your hard work has led up to this moment! You are now ready to start your capstone project! Think of your Capstone Project as an MVP for a real-world application. I want to see it working and running!

The project will need to satisy the following criteria:

- it needs to have a **backend** and a **frontend**
- the backend must be done in **Java** (ideally, in Spring Boot)
- the frontend can be done with any technology you want
- it needs to have a **database** of some sort

## Proposals

To start, we will break out into teams and create a proposal for our projects. Don't worry about the superfluous details like address information or phone numbers; I want you to be concerned about the broader details like the technologies you'll use, what your application will ultimately be for, and what milestones you're anticipating hitting.

## Agile

Once the proposal is submitted and approved, it is time to start development. Take an **agile** approach and assign roles in your team. Roles include but are not limited to:

- Product Owner
- Scribe
- Scrum Master
- Developer

I highly recommend creating a system to track tasks and issues. Utilize **Trello** or **Github Project** kanban boards in order to neatly and efficiently keep track of what needs to be done what has been done.

The milestones you defined in your proposal should more or less align neatly with the idea of **sprints**. Incorporate working in sprints to better focus on achieving specific outcomes.
