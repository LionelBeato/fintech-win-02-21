## Angular Resources

- [Angular Documentation | _angular.io_](https://angular.io/docs): very helpful starting point. If you're not sure of about a functionality, simply search for it here! For example, the method `ngOnInit()` is defined in the interface [`Oninit`](https://angular.io/api/core/OnInit).

- [Angular Lifecycle Hooks explained | _freecodecamp_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/angular-lifecycle-hooks/): freeCodeCamp explainer for lifecycle hooks.

- [Build Your First Angular app | _scrimba_](https://scrimba.com/learn/yourfirstangularapp): this site is an awesome resource with hands-on interactive tutorials. I haven't taken this one but they're all generally very good across the board.
